          limitation lost business opportunities, lost revenues, or loss of anticipated profits or any other pecuniary
          or non-pecuniary loss or damage of any nature whatsoever) arising out of or relating to (i) this agreement,
          (ii) the services, the site or any reference site, or (iii) your use or inability to use the services, the
          site (including any and all materials) or any reference sites, even if Wallora or a Wallora authorized
          representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will Wallora or any of its
          contractors, directors, employees, agents, third party partners, licensors or suppliers’ total liability to
          you for all damages, liabilities, losses, and causes of action arising out of or relating to (i) this
          Agreement, (ii) the Services, (iii) your use or inability to use the Services or the Site (including any and

          reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and Wallora, and that the warranty disclaimers
          and the limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the bargain between you and

          out of or related to your use or misuse of the Services or of the Site, any violation by you of this

          interruption, loss of programs or information, and the like) arising out of the use of or inability to use the
